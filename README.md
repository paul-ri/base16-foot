**NOTE:** All files in this repository are generated by [base16-builder-python](https://github.com/InspectorMustache/base16-builder-python)

## Installation

**Manual installation:**  
Copy the content of a colors from the `colors/` folder into your `foot.ini` configuration file. Check `man foot.ini` for more details.

**Automatic:**  
With [base16-universal-manager](https://github.com/paul-ri/base16-universal-manager) you can update colors from the command line.

### "256" Variations

The 256 variations are provided so that anyone who wishes to continue using the 16 ANSI colors won't end up with weird colors instead of bright colors. However since base16 uses only 16-color themes, this results in all of the bright colors mirroring their non-bright colors, rather than being additional colors. If you use the 256 variations, you will also need to use the [Base16 Shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) script to maintain proper compatibility with the base16 themes.

## Build
To update the colors files, run the make command `make build` from the root folder.

**make dependencies:** python, GNU make
